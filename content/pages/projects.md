The final project for this course is a costume piece either real or imagined, using one or more of the methods learned OR demonstrated in class. This is an opportunity to further explore techniques you've tried or to try ones that have been demonstrated. This must be a fairly substantial project; we will discuss this more fully as we go along. You will develop an idea, submit a detailed drawing, and on approval by the instructor build your piece. Pieces will be presented to the class on the last day of classes.

At midterm (Ses #13) you will present to the class your sketch of the final project, a timeline with benchmarks, a materials list, and your journal of sources, inspiration, development, etc.
